# Tech 201 Containerisation with Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualisation to deliver software in packages called containers.

## What are Containers?
Containers are a form of operating system virtualisation. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

### Benefits of containers
- Containers require less system resources than traditional or hardware virtual machine environments because they don't include operating system images.
- Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different OS and hardware platforms.
- DevOps teams know applications in containers will run the same regardless of where they are deployed.
- Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched or scaled.
- Containers support agile and DevOps efforts to accelerate development, test, and production cycles.

## Why use Docker? What are some of the benfits?
Docker is a popular tool used by several large companies like Paypal, ADP and Spotify, and its adoption by companies continues to grow. Some of the advantages of using Docker includes better return on investment & cost savings, compatibility & maintainability, simplicity, rapid deployment, continuous deployment & testing, multi-cloud platforms and more.
Docker containers share their operating systemn so they run as isolated processes regardless of the host OS, this means that its containers can run on any computer on any infrastructure and in any cloud. The portability, flexibility and simplicity that this enables is a key reason why Docker is such a powerful tool.
